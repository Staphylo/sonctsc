In this vs test environment [frr-vrf-patch](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/3763) is NOT imported which result in the failure of some vrf related test cases.

Increasing in-band bandwidth to CPU goes beyond ZTP.  It is applicable even to a simple case of download code via in-band network using \"sonic_installer install\" command. Also there may be more applications which may require more bandwidth that what is set to by default.\r\n\r\n2. We can have ZTP change the default value at runtime but it will also have to roll back the change. So if user changes the value to something else during ZTP process, the ZTP service may not be aware of it. It would have been easy if the CIR/CBS config was available in config db. However, that is not the case as we need to use a different copp.json file and a command to apply the changes.\r\n\r\nGiven above two reasons,  I feel we should increase the default value to a reasonable agreed upon value.",

That value can be same or improved for ZTP scenario, since during that time no other protocols are running yet. \r\n\r\nIf value need to go beyond the SONiC defined default value, I prefer dynamically change based on the ZTP enable and disable.",
