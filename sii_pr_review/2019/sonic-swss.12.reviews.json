For example, in MCLAG scenario, the standby device will change the local mac address to the mac address of active device. If the standby device is warm rebooted, this mac address must be the same as that before warm-restart, if not, the portchannel will be broken and the data forwarding may be blocked."

Increasing in-band bandwidth to CPU goes beyond ZTP.  It is applicable even to a simple case of download code via in-band network using \"sonic_installer install\" command. Also there may be more applications which may require more bandwidth that what is set to by default.\r\n\r\n2. We can have ZTP change the default value at runtime but it will also have to roll back the change. So if user changes the value to something else during ZTP process, the ZTP service may not be aware of it. It would have been easy if the CIR/CBS config was available in config db. However, that is not the case as we need to use a different copp.json file and a command to apply the changes.\r\n\r\nGiven above two reasons,  I feel we should increase the default value to a reasonable agreed upon value."
