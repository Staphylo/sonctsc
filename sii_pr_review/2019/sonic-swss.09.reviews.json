Since we don't have the intfsyncd now, we have to push to the hardware, the only automatically-derived-system-wide-link-local-address ip2me route (the default config case) at the initialization time. This PR addresses that (bootup default case for having the fe80 /128 and fe80 /10 CPU routes).\r\nHaving said that, we can have more than 1 link-local addresses assigned to the interfaces (just like the global IPv6 addresses). And assigning a new link-local address doesn't have to delete the automatically derived (MAC based by Linux) link-local address. Also, there can be cases in future where we have a VRRPv3 Virtual IPv6 Link-local address that is assigned to the VRRP Master routing interfaces (another case where we have multiple link-local addresses on the interface).",
