        "comment_body": "The existing implementation was targeting swss docker warm restart assuming stateDB and host netdev not touched.\r\n\r\nAs to system warm reboot,  for going up path, we need to make sure syncd/libsai/SDK have finished their tasks ( one of tasks is to recreate host interfaces), probably syncd should set a flag in stateDB (maybe reuse WARM_RESTART_TABLE, state=reconciled).  Then swss starts it tasks.\r\n\r\nSince no real order control between portsyncd/portmgrd and orchagent,  we should not re-apply the default config in port config file which may cause port state flapping and other unwanted consequence.  While portmgrd has all up to date data for all config it had applied before shutdown, it is ok for it to replay the data. \r\n\r\nAs to portState in StateDB,  it is an indication that netdev has been created.  During warm reboot, libsai/SDK/syncd should have guaranteed that state,  the easy way is to save and restore it during reboot.  Note, swss needs the state reconciled signal from syncd in stateDB to proceed.\r\n\r\nJust my 2cents about port state restore during system warm reboot.  Of course there are other alternatives to the problem.\r\n  #Resolved"

All SAI states are recovered and all host interfaces are created (not bring up). Then, portsyncd will enumerate all ports and put them into state db. portmgrd will bring them up.\r\n\r\nIn the code, bring the port down is an issue, I think he needs to figure out how to properly solve this one.

There is `no order control`. Some mechanism is necessary to ensure that netdevs have been created,  either some flag set by syncd or orchagent,  or you check the existence of each netdev specifically.\r\n\r\nAgain, the default setting in port config file should not be applied again (as in portsyncd), it could cause ASIC port state flapping.  We'll want to add more and more incremental update support for port attribute config in portmgrd process.\r\n\r\nFor port state in stateDB, either `save and restore` if we want to rely on the flag from lower layer,  or portsyncd check the existence of each netdev and set the state again.  Personally I prefer the first alternative, second alternative is unnecessarily complex and does't bring any extra benefit. \r\n #Resolved"

I have added the pull request: https://github.com/Azure/sonic-buildimage/pull/2064 in buildimage to update the submodule as well as update the virtual switch so that it will pass after both commits are merged."
