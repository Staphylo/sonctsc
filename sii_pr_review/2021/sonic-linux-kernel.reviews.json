Instead of applying the fix to the code, it's generated in a opposite way, the content of the wrong patch is reverting the first part of the patch, so it can still building but make the fix incomplete."

Will amend the commit to update the commit message.\r\n3. Will signoff the commit and the patch through a new commit.\r\n4. The `dni_dps460` driver is defined only in sonic-linux-kernel via `patch/driver-hwmon-pmbus-dni_dps460.patch` and not available in upstream linux. Currently this driver is used only in Dell S6000 platform for accessing PSU attributes.\r\n\r\n"

Your explanation in item 1. is very good, and is perfect to have in a commit message, so people do not have to read the merge/pull request discussion.\r\n\r\nRegarding 4., I know the driver is not in upstream Linux, but that is the goal, and nothing would prevent that. To avoid future porting work, it\u2019d be great, if you sent the whole driver upstream, seeing that you also have access to the hardware."

It\u2019d be great, if the Celestica DX010 would be mentioned here too.\r\n\r\nAlso, I really think a message to stable@vger.kernel.org with the backport request should be sent. (And soon SONiC should switch to Linux 5.10 anyway. ;-))"
