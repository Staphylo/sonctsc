I see no real reason it should take that long. On my local build server that operation completes fast enough that I don't need any wait. \r\n\r\nIn the interest of moving forward I can simply have it wait 30 seconds which would ensure the tests passes each time. I could also remove that part of the test since it isn't meaningful in testing if the dependency functioned, its just a sanity check. \r\n\r\nIf neither of these options is acceptable we will need to do some more in depth debugging about why this is behaving like it is. \r\n\r\nAnother strange part of the behavior is that in order to test I have been dumping the syslog into stdout and it seems that as soon as I attempt to remove the portchannel nothing is printed out of the syslog even if I wait a while.

The voq system neigh test already checks for presence of the neighbor in kernel on the inband interface. But this test is skipped by PR #1807. Since the PR #1686 was merged just after the PR #1807 was merged, virtual chassis tests did not catch the problem introduced by PR #1686. \r\n\r\nThe problem that lead to skipping the virtual chassis tests has been fixed by PRs Azure/sonic-buildimage#8008 and PR #1811. The PR #1811 also enables the skipped tests. So just merging PR Azure/sonic-buildimage#8008 and PR #1811 will be enough. We do not need any enhancements in virtual chassis tests by another PR.\r\n\r\nTagging Anshu and Suresh, for their info: @anshuv-mfst , @minionatwork \r\n"

Yes, the BGP unnumbered might work without configuring the ipv6 link local on an interface.\r\n2. Yes, IPv6 LL is enabled by default in the kernel stack and the config command is  not enabling/disabling the IPv6 LL in stack. Basically we are not touching that part here.\r\n3. The global/interface enable config command will create the RIF in the hardware, if there is no ipv6 global address configured on a interface and global/interface disable config command will delete the RIF in the hardware, if there is no ipv6 global address configured on a interface.\r\n"
