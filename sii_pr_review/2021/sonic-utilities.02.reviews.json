I think there is another way to do this, which is directly modifying the `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Should I do that instead?\r\n\r\nNo, that also will not work because the tests are run in the slave container; you cannot modify the sysctl values at runtime. They must be added to the `docker run` command line. See here: https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/197\r\n\r\n@lguohan: Should we consider running the slave container with the appropriate `--sysctl` parameters, or should @sumukhatv instead mock functions which rely on this support?\r\n\r\nEdit: Trying to understand why we didn't see this issue with Jenkins. I believe it is because with Jenkins, we add the `--privileged` option to the `docker run` command line, whereas Azure Pipelines [doesn't](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-troubleshooting#cannot-connect-to-underlying-docker-api-or-run-privileged-containers) run the container in privileged mode?\r\n\r\nEdit 2: I just pushed a commit to add the `--privileged` flag as an option to the container in AP, and it seems to have worked! :)"

For my application I generate a dump by executing a command inside docker (lets say this command takes 10 sec). Now, if I don't have this proposed mechanism to extend dump generation I have to continuously print my dump to syslog which has the following issues:\r\n1. I do not know at which point user wants to generate a dump so even if my app continuously prints dump information to syslog I might not catch the right point of time or my daemon can crash and I will lose that information. \r\n2. I produce a lot of load on syslog and on my app causing it to execute a debug dump command all the time\r\n3. Syslog will be bloated with extensions debug output and will distract user from analyzing logs."

This is the key of the problem, the reason should be found out. Previously, it return None in SonicV2Connector.get_all->DBInterface.get_all->blockable.wrapped at file sonic-py-swsssdk/src/swsssdk/interface.py line 53.\r\n  \r\n> Please, see the logs below. There are outputs of `redis-cli MONITOR` on a different builds(9fda295c - old build, af357f3e - new build, on which the defect has occurred):\r\n> [redis_monitor_af357f3e.txt](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-utilities/files/5842017/redis_monitor_af357f3e.txt)\r\n> [redis_monitor_9fda295c.txt](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-utilities/files/5842015/redis_monitor_9fda295c.txt)\r\n> As I mentioned in the issue, I have commented the places in the logs, in which the operations above are performed.\r\n\r\nI cannot download log files at the moment, but I think it maybe the DEL operations by intfmgrd.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I though that the while loop has made as workaround to check that the system handled `config_db.set_entry(table_name, interface_name, None)` operation, because the system lose DEL operation when delete and add entry with the same name or something else:\r\n> `# When config_db del entry and then add entry with same key, the DEL will lost.`\r\n\r\nNo, your thinking is beyond it was. The while loop was to wait real DEL op was executed over. It is used to handle case b) mentioned before, that it has nothing to do with this case - or case a). The system is never lose real DEL operations. The workaround is to handle rebind (unbind->bind) in bind command, it is to del existent entry just like unbind. The lost in notes is because two continuous operations were merged when addToSync.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Maybe, for example, intfmgrd daemon became to handle changes in config_db sequentially, so, currently it does not lose DEL operation?\r\n\r\nI think intfmgrd hasn't been changed yet, while SyncMap/addToSync changed for holding DEL and SET, so your conclusion should be right."

In older builds(`9fda295c` in my case), the record has not being deleted by the system, it just cleaned up the table, so, `get_all `operation was returning None and bind command was working fine.\r\nIf the behavior is expected, I think the issue could be solved by using operation `exists `for `INTERFACE_TABLE|EthernetXX`, and if does not exist, the interface is currently unbound.\r\nIf the behavior is not expected, I will continue investigating the issue in this direction."

Does `get_all` return not None or block itself? I haven't found codes changed.\r\nBy the way, in redis_monitor_af357f3e.txt interface Ethernet8 had been bond before this bind command?

        "comment_body": "@tylerlinp,\r\nThank you for confirmation.\r\n> get_all != None is just same as exists. Does get_all return not None or block itself?\r\n\r\nNot completely so. exists checks whether the key exists or not, but `get_all ` checks what the key contains. If the keys does not exist, `get_all ` will cause exception throwing with according log in syslog, like `Feb 28 18:20:01.457447 sonic WARNING sniffer: :- operator(): Key '{INTERFACE_TABLE|Ethernet36}' unavailable in database '{STATE_DB}'`, and return some trash(print result of this trash: `<swsscommon.swsscommon.FieldValueMap; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'swss::TableMap *' at 0x7f731246a030> >`).\r\n\r\n> I haven't found codes changed.\r\n\r\nMe too. I think the reason, why bind operation was working is that the record in `STATE_DB `never has not being deleted before, what the recorded logs confirm.\r\n\r\n>By the way, in redis_monitor_af357f3e.txt interface Ethernet8 had been bond before this bind command? If not, that is say now \r\nDEL is notified even though entry absence.\r\n\r\nYes, `Ethernet8 `was not bound. Seems your assumption is right. I have tested with rebinding to another VRF, the behavior is the same, bind operation stucks on while loop.\r\n\r\nAny way, I will update the PR with `exists`, test it and ping you, when it will be done."
