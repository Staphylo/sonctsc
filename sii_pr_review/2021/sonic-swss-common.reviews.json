Currently (before my change) when you want to build Sonic for armhf on amd64 host you first create slave docker image for armhf (meaning all executable inside the docker image are of armhf architecture). And then you build Sonic inside this slave armhf (architecture) docker as if you are on the native armhf host. However you can't run armhf binary (from within the slave docker) on the amd64 host directly. You need to use qemu emulation for every bit of armhf executable. For example when you compile with gcc, this gcc is armhf gcc and to  run it you need to run \"qemu gcc\" using emulation. Emulation is extremely slow, so it causes the entire Sonic build for armhf on amd64 host take 22-24 hours. My change basically replaces the emulation with cross-compilation that is as fast as native compilation. So using the cross-compilation make Sonic build for armhf on amd64 host to complete in about 6 hours only.\r\nLet me know if it is clear enough."

Not for C++ application usage.\r\n\r\nThere are some functionalities are not easy/possible to purely implemented in C++, such as namespace property (it is a C++ keyword). So original I implement them in `pythoncode` block. Later I found these features are not available in C++ subclasses, and finally python subclasses. So I made the changes here, and let python subclass inherit like this:\r\n- SonicV2Connector_Native (C++)\r\n- SonicV2Connector (python): SonicV2Connector_Native\r\n- ConfigDBConnector_Native (C++): SonicV2Connector_Native\r\n- ConfigDBConnector (python): SonicV2Connector, ConfigDBConnector_Native\r\n\r\nSo the python subclass will inherit all the members from python base class.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn reply to: [773590454](https://github.com/Azure/sonic-swss-common/pull/453#issuecomment-773590454) [](ancestors = 773590454)"
