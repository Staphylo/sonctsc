I was not able to find the wpa-supplicant project on github.com to submit this fix directly to that project.\r\n\r\nwpa-supplicant belongs to hostap project https://w1.fi/hostapd/ . Its community maintains or contributes the repository by mail-list https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/CONTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\nBut I think we should merge this PR into our repo, because we don't always follow the latest commit of upstream.\r\n @lguohan Do you have any concern about merging this PR?"
