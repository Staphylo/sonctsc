Do you know if we need to patch libnl to support xpn?\r\n\r\nIn current upstreamed libnl3, there is no included support in the genl netlink handling for MACsec at all; only in the route netlink handling is there any included MACsec support, but this is insufficient to fully configure MACsec Linux driver... genl netlink handling is needed for this.  However, as mentioned in our MACsec HLD discussions, I have written all the genl netlink parsing/handling for MACsec and am planning on contributing this support to SONiC as needed.  This genl netlink handling supports the latest definition of Linux MACsec driver attributes (from Linux if_macsec.h), which includes needed XPN attributes.\r\n\r\nwpa-supplicant probably needs enhancement for improved detection of driver capabilities.  For instance, current MACsec driver does not support XPN cipher suites, but there is no way to convey what cipher suites are supported by the driver to the PAE/KaY component via the current wpa-supplicant driver interface."
