What we did more is alloc buffer for each options during walk, this may benefit if you want to modify several options at the same time, you don't need walk it again (PcapPlusPlus need). I think this is different consideration from different point of view. \r\nIf you have performance consideration, I think we can improve in future like optimize memory allocation, batch update counter to have less Redis api calls ... \r\nThanks Vivek for comments, let's keep touch to make the code better.

        "comment_body": "Thanks for taking time to analyze. I agree that the pcaplus will still have to read the packet byte by byte. My point in using an external library was to let the heavy lifting of the packet processing be handled by the lib which makes the code less error-prone and easy to maintain and read.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not super familiar with PcapPlus but having a brief look at the code it seems, the DhcpV6Layer class provides multiple API's to walk-through, add, delete options. And if an option is malformed the `DhcpV6Option::getType` should return DHCPV6_OPT_UNKNOWN as i understand. Wouldn't that let us know if the option is malformed ?https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/Packet++/src/DhcpV6Layer.cpp#L12\r\n\r\nRegarding your comment\r\n\r\n> > PcapPlusPlus stops the walk when find the target option user interested, here we want to walk all options for a full packet check (detect all malformed TLVs). What we did more is alloc buffer for each options during walk, this may benefit if you want to modify several options at the same time, you don't need walk it again (PcapPlusPlus need).\r\n\r\nIf we aren't editing options, i think pcaplus just does one walk over the entire data if we are looping over it option by option, \r\nhttps://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/blob/142e3de80660343f61c8596d0c50f728c9d9c554/Packet%2B%2B/src/DhcpV6Layer.cpp#L154 && https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/blob/142e3de80660343f61c8596d0c50f728c9d9c554/Packet%2B%2B/src/DhcpV6Layer.cpp#L159\r\n\r\nModifying multiple options is one use-case where the current solution seem to have an edge, In Pcapplus, i think it does that by modifying options one-by-one. \r\n\r\nRegardless, i think using a standardized library greatly reduces chances of error and make the code much cleaner. So i still think using the external lib might be a better/safe choice, let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
