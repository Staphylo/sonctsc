So, I did migration. But previous cases were kept failing, I don't have result to compare, I checked setup phase and it passed. I didn't verify each case result. I am thinking to fix setup part firstly to unblock test running and then if there is something new failure, let's fix them step by step.",

Ensure that the `pre-commit` package is installed:\n```\nsudo pip install pre-commit\n```\n3. Go to repository root folder\n4. Install the pre-commit hooks:\n```\npre-commit install\n```\n5. Use pre-commit to check staged file:\n```\npre-commit\n```\n6. Alternatively, you can check committed files using:\n```\npre-commit run --from-ref <commit_id> --to-ref <commit_id>\n```",
